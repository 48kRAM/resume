This is my resume. Being the Linux nerd that I am, it is written in LaTeX and published in
source form.

## Building from source

Make sure you have updated the submodule so that you have the 'Deedy-Resume' class files.
This document requires XeLaTeX, which can usually be installed as part of "texlive-xetex".

To create the PDF, simply run

```
make
```

after installing the dependencies.
